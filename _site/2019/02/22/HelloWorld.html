<p>22 Feb 2019 - Thomas V.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Thomas and I’m an programmer.</p>

<p>Okay here we go, I’m actually starting a blog. Why am I doing this. I mean writing, and texts and ehm. yeah that’s really not my strong side.</p>

<!--read more-->

<p>Wait stop, I’m getting overexcited and rambling on like a teenager. Let’s try that again.<br />
I’m Thomas and I’m here, because I’m passioned about coding. 
Well not passioned like with my wife and children, but I AM obsessed with fine tuning my skills.
I read books on the subject and I tend to use my spare time to play around with private projects. 
Don’t get me wrong, I do have a life. I even occasionally go for a run.</p>

<p>Focus Thomas focus. So I read and practice which generates some experience and thoughs, and I needed some placed to let it all out. 
I’d normally talk to people around me, and people are nice to listen and comment, but I feel like a need a new place to let it go, and this is so much better than talking to a rubber duck.</p>

<p>By now, you may have noticed that my process is creative (chaotic). 
Well clever you. I see myself as a creative. I can draw, and do so both in my free time and on work. 
I think a drawing is the best way to get a shared and clear picture of something complex, which coding usually is.</p>

<p>I also like psycology and behavial science.
In fact, back when I had to choose my education, I picked computers over psycology. 
Even though I never regretted that choice, I’ll always have a profound interest on how the human mind works.
My interest in behavial science started when I stumbled upon a book called “thinking fast and slow”, and once I read that one, I just couldn’t stop.
It’s interesting because it’s like a live steamed manual on human software, written by the users of the system.</p>

<p>I have a dream of one day being able to unite the 3 passions in my professional career. 
I don’t see allot of job openings, for a professional programmer, with insight in the human psyche and who also likes to draw.
That said, I do think that the tree things complement each other, and I hope to show exactly that on this here blog.</p>

<p>I apologize for my sketchy first post, but I just needed to get something out there.
I plan to get a retine up and running, and post something regularely.</p>

<p>Sincerly,
Thomas Volden</p>
