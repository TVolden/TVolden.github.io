# About me

Hi I'm Thomas. 

I'm a danish PhD fellow at IT University of Copenhagen and former professional programmer for 10+ yeras.
I research the player experience of games through a lens of academic emotions.
My main contribution to the field is my analysis of confusion in games and how it may give new insights into a more accurate player experience model.
